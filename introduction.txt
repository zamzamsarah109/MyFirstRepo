# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Zamzam Sarah, but I like to go by Zammy. I'm passionate about transforming education in rural Africa and using data to find solutions to educational challenges. With a background in Data Analytics, I aim to empower underserved communities by improving access to quality education.

I enjoy technology, learning new skills, and sharing knowledge with others. This GitHub journey is an exciting step for me to build and showcase projects that can make a difference.
